Welcome! My name is Chi-Kang Pai, but you can call me CK or Brandon. I am a proud alumnus of National Taiwan University, where I majored in Electrical Engineering with a focus on physics and signal processing. I am thrilled to be embarking on a new adventure as an incoming PhD researcher @ [Harvard CCB](https://chemistry.harvard.edu/).

Driven by my dedication to biotech and healthcare, I've merged optical science with software engineering in my academic and research pursuits. I have done research with Prof. [Shi-Wei Chu](https://sites.google.com/site/ntubiooptic/members/shi-wei-chu) in NTU physics, [Prof. Guo-Yang Li](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/all_time/11935.html) at the HST-Wellman Summer Institute for Biomedical Optics, and [Prof. Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/) in NTU EE.

My journey also extends to software development, where my work at [Heptabase](https://heptabase.com/) to build my favorite software product, and at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-studio) building AI tools. These experiences have solidified my commitment to innovating tools and technologies aimed at enhancing patient care and advancing human health.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in having a chat with me!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
