[Heptabase](https://heptabase.com/) is my favorite software product! I now spent hours each day using this product to LEARN. This is a software to help you understand complex topics. You can visualize your thoughts in a 2D whiteboard, which I think is the best way to build a deep understanding of any topic. I personally use this when reading books, articles on the Internet, and research papers.

My connection to Heptabase is personal and profound. I had the privilege of meeting [Alan](https://www.alanchan.me/), the company's founder, during my participation in the IPhO camp in Taiwan. Additionally, I befriended one of the founding engineers, [Nick](https://beforemkfs.com/), through the NTU Toastmasters Club. Both Alan and Nick are exceptionally talented and inspiring individuals who I greatly admire. Collaborating with them, even for a short duration of a month, has been an unforgettable and enriching experience.

Heptabase's achievements are further underscored by its association with the prestigious Y-Combinator in San Francisco, a testament to its innovative vision and potential. The product has garnered a strong user base, with thousands of individuals expressing their love and support for it. The opportunity to work alongside the creators of such an outstanding product is incredibly exciting and I consider it a great honor. Their commitment to excellence and innovation is not just inspiring but motivates me to contribute to their ongoing success.
