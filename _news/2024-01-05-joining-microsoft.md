I started joining Microsoft as a front-end intern starting 2024, after I finished my internship at Heptabase.
The product I am developing here is the "AI studio", which consists of document intelligence studio and other services. I worked with a senior engineer to build libraries that can demonstrate different components in the product. 

The experience working in a large company is very cool! The care that they put on each individual is astonishing. Personally I think working in Microsoft can be a great way to grow your engineering skills, however, the variance between groups is large. At least the group I joined have a great culture, and I learned a lot from my mentor.
